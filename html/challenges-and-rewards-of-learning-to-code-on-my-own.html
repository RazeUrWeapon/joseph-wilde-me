                <p>We all have to start somewhere. And if you’re like me, an adult learner, that might mean learning on your own.</p>
                <p>This may seem like an intimidating task at first, but don’t let that deter you. Learning to code can be an incredibly rewarding journey.</p>
                <p>In this post, I'll share my experience of learning to code on my own, along with the challenges and rewards that come with it.</p>
                <div id="part-one">
                    <h3>What I found difficult about coding from the start.</h3>
                    <p>There’s no denying learning to code on your own is hard. Before starting my journey I wondered if I was even capable of understanding a programming language.</p>
                    <p>However, despite the unknown, I dove straight in.</p>
                    <p>In the beginning I had countless questions… </p>
                    <p>“What language should I learn first?”<br>“Is this language even in demand?”<br>“What if I learn this and don’t like it?”<br>“What if I would like another language more?”</p>
                    <p>The list goes on and on.</p>
                    <p>I remember wanting someone to ask all these questions to. Someone who knew me personally so they could give specific feedback, but I didn’t have that.</p>
                    <p>I eventually decided on front end web development and started learning the basics. I spent hour upon hour learning all these concepts that were new to me. Some came easier than others, but there were times I spent days on a particular topic.</p>
                    <p>I knew if I were going to really learn this stuff, I was going to have to put a lot of time into it. This meant saying no to fun weekend adventures and limiting my down time.</p>
                    <p>Even now (as I’m still learning) I say no to many things and put the majority of my time into learning JavaScript.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="part-two">
                    <h3>How I overcame these difficulties and what helped me along the way.</h3>
                    <p>Even though I had no one in my immediate circle that knew how to code, I knew there had to be a way to get involved with people who did. I was on the hunt for a coding community from the very beginning.</p>
                    <p>I found the Frontendmentor.io Slack community very early on. It was great to have like-minded people to ask questions to and bounce ideas off of. I was even able to give occasional feedback to people who were less experienced.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/"><div class="article-img" style="background-image: url('../img/frontendmentor.png');"></div></a>
                    <p>There are many communities out there, and from my experience most are very welcoming and encouraging.</p>
                    <p>Saying no to every leisure activity that came my way wasn’t the most ideal situation. I knew there had to be a better way.</p>
                    <p>That’s when I decided to start a coding time sheet. It’s a simple Google sheet that keeps track of how much time I spend actually sitting down at the computer coding or learning new concepts. </p>
                    <p>Using this time sheet I made it a rule to get in at least 40 hours a week. If I hit my goal I would allow myself some down time.</p>
                    <p>This was great because it kept me accountable. I was able to look back at the exact times I spent coding and what I worked on.</p>

                    <h3>The rewards that come with learning to code.</h3>
                    <p>This is my favorite part.</p>
                    <p>I had no idea how rewarding this journey could be and I’m just getting started. </p>
                    <a href="#"><div class="article-img" style="background-image: url('../img/rewards_article.jpg');"></div></a>
                    <p>Some of my favorite rewards so far…</p>
                    <p>The satisfaction of finally understanding how something works and being able to build on that knowledge. The sense of accomplishment when finishing a project I started from scratch. The elation of finding the right solution after hours (or days) of struggling. The pleasure of working on something you're passionate about for hours on end.</p>
                    <p>All these things are a big part of why I love to code, and I haven’t even landed a full-time job yet! </p>

                    <h3>Is it worth it to try coding on your own?</h3>
                    <p>Just watch this video:</p>

                    <p>Haha, but seriously, I would recommend anyone who is on the fence about taking the leap to just do it.</p>
                    <p>Give it a try and allow yourself to get past the beginning learning stages. As soon as you’re able to build things on your own there is no doubt you’ll fall in love with coding too.</p>
                    <p>Don’t worry about “learning on your own,” you’ll have many tools, resources and people who will help you along the way.</p>
                    <p>I took the self-taught route, but never felt alone in my journey.</p>
                    <p>If you want to know the specific resources I used you can read this article: <a href="what-resources-i-used-to-teach-myself-how-to-code.html">What Resources I Used To Teach Myself How To Code in Just 4 Months!</a></p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>So there you have it - coding can be hard, fun, and rewarding.</p>
                    <p>It may take some time and practice to get the hang of it, but don’t give up! I promise that if you stick with it, learning how to code can be an incredibly satisfying experience.</p>
                    <p>If you ever need a little help or want to chat about all things coding-related, feel free to reach out. I’m always here to lend a hand (or keyboard)!</p>
                    <p>Happy coding!</p>
