                <p>Finding the right resources to teach yourself how to code can be daunting. With so many different platforms, courses and tutorials out there, it's hard to know where to start.</p>
                <p>But that’s okay, because below you’ll find the top resources which helped me go from complete beginner to (almost) confident programmer in just 4 months!</p>
                <h3>The beginning.</h3>
                <p>It was September 9th 2021 when I thought to myself “alright, today’s the day.” I had made the decision to start coding.</p>
                <p>It’s been something I’ve thought about for years, but was too busy wrapped up in my love for playing poker professionally and putting all my extra hours off the felt into studying.</p>
                <div id="part-one">
                    <h3>Okay so…  where do I start? (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder" class="heading-link">Coder Coder YouTube Channel.</a>)</h3>
                    <p>I did what I think most people would do in this day and age… head over to YouTube.</p>
                    <p>The first video I stumbled upon that grabbed my attention was from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder">Coder Coder.</a></p>
                    <p>It was her video "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysEN5RaKOlA">Learn web development as an absolute beginner.</a>"</p>
                    <p>Her videos are very well done and easy to understand. If you’re interested in learning Front End Development you should definitely check out her content.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="part-two">
                    <h3>Hmm.. this seems fun, I want to learn more. (<a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" class="heading-link">Teamtreehouse.com</a>)</h3>
                    <p>After watching the above video I surfed YouTube a little longer then did some research on the best courses to learn web development.</p>
                    <p>I finally decided on Teamtreehouse.com because they use video and seemed to have many well-structured courses.</p>
                    <p>Treehouse was incredibly useful in the beginning. Their format was perfectly laid out with video, coding challenges and quizzes along the way. It was very easy to follow, kept me engaged and wanting to learn more.</p>
                    <p>If you’re looking for training that uses video and has great structure, I would highly recommend Teamtreehouse.com!</p>
                    <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/"><div class="article-img" style="background-image: url('../img/teamtreehouse_article.png');"></div></a>
                </div>
                <div id="part-three">
                    <h3>Transitioning from complete beginner to “I really want to do this.” (<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">Freecodecamp.org</a>)</h3>
                    <p>After going through most of the Front End Development course on Treehouse I started hitting roadblocks, things started to get challenging.</p>
                    <p>That’s when I started using <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn">Freecodecamp.org</a>.</p>
                    <p>I’d go through content on Treehouse during the day, then find the exact same topics on Freecodecamp to learn at night. This gave me more practice and really helped me deepen my understanding in areas where I was struggling.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn"><div class="article-img" style="background-image: url('../img/freecodecamp_article.png');"></div></a>
                </div>
                <div id="part-four">
                    <h3>Alright, I’ve learned enough. I want to build something! (<a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/">Frontendmentor.io</a>)</h3>
                    <p>I learned about Frontendmentor.io from another one of Coder Coder’s YouTube videos and wanted to give it a try.</p>
                    <p>It had been about a month and half since I wrote my first line of code and I was ready to start putting what I’ve learned to use!</p>
                    <p>I started with their most basic project making a media card and will never forget that feeling of opening a fresh project on my own… I was completely lost.</p>
                    <p>What happened? Why couldn’t I remember everything I’ve learned? I still don’t know the answer to that question, but I do know doing projects on my own without anyone leading the way was the absolute best decision I made in my coding journey up to this point.</p>
                    <p>Frontendmentor is a great way to get you out of “tutorial hell” and into more real world situations. I ran into many hiccups and was forced to figure things out on my own (and Google.)</p>
                    <p>This is how I really started to learn and concepts started to stick.</p>
                    <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/"><div class="article-img" style="background-image: url('../img/frontendmentor.png');"></div></a>
                </div>
                <div id="part-five">
                    <h3>Let’s put my skills to the test. (<a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars.com</a>)</h3>
                    <p><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars.com</a> gave me challenges without showing me exactly what to do and taught me to start thinking like a programmer.</p>
                    <p>This was great because up to this point I hadn’t put much of my JavaScript knowledge to the test.</p>
                    <p>They have 8 different difficulties so you can find something even if you’re a beginner. Their levels go from 8kyu being the easiest to 1kyu being the hardest.</p>
                    <p>I particularly like the problems with a backstory, it makes solving them a little more fun.</p>
                    <p>When on the site you can search by kata on the left hand side - I’ve found searching by most popular usually gets me the best results.</p>
                    <p>Go check them out and put your skills to the test!</p>

                <div id="part-six">
                    <h3>Okay, maybe I don’t know as much as I thought. Back to learning! (<a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">TheOdinProject.com</a>)</h3>
                    <p>The Odin Project is an open source training platform that puts together the best resources on the internet in a structured way.</p>
                    <p>For me, things started to get real when I started The Odin Project. In the beginning they help you with setting up a virtual machine, installing Linux and working from the command line.</p>
                    <p>Each topic is thoroughly covered with articles, coding challenges from other websites and sometimes video. I really liked how this made me slow down, read through each topic and fully understand concepts before moving on.</p>
                    <p>Along with in-depth courses they give you plenty of projects to do along the way. These aren’t like other tutorials, they force you to think on your own and to come up with your own solutions using nothing but the internet and course material you’ve already been through.</p>
                    <p>I’m currently still working through The Odin Project so come on over and join me!</p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>This article is just a quick overview of my favorite online resources to learn coding. I highly recommend giving them all a try, as each one has something different to offer. I’ve tried them all and can attest to their effectiveness.</p>
                    <p>If you're looking for some more help getting started, or just want to geek out about coding, feel free to reach out. I'd be happy to chat and answer any questions you may have. In the meantime, get out there and start building some amazing things! </p>
                    <p>Happy Coding!</p>
